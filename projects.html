            WAMS is an API for creating Workspace Applications across Multiple Surfaces. It has proven to greatly
            reduce the amount of code required to create multi-surface applications, and enables developers to write
            much more meaningful code. The API has been used to created applications such as drawing applications,
            image sharing, card table simulator and small party games. Built using Javascript and NodeJS. This is an
            ongoing project I am developing for Dr. Carl Gutwin in the HCI lab.

            The CSSS website informs visitors of who the CSSS are and what they do as a group at the University of Saskatchewan.  It is designed to be easily maintained by executive members of the CSSS without extensive knowledge of the backend code or website development. It has proven to be a great improvement over the existing CSSS website.
            Built using HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, and PHP
            This project was developed by team of 3 members for the "Website Design/Development" course (CMPT 281).
